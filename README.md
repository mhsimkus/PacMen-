# PacMen-
Factory for Making PacMen 
When button "Add PacMan" is pressed you create new pacman images and add it to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
You can also make each pacman bounce off any wall it hits. 
Start by getting at least one pacman positioned and viewable.
